Once the OSticket install is complete, I started configuring the admin profile. After, I logged into OSticket as the admin and it will open up to the homepage. I set up the departments staying in the "Admin Panel" and under the "Agents tab" I will click on "Departments" and then click on "Add New Department". Then I named the department to eventually add agents who can submit and work on tickets. After I configured the teams to designate the agents on certain teams/levels. to create the teams I stayed in the admin panel and selected the "teams tab" and created two teams named Level I and Level II support. The configured it so that anyone can create tickets by staying in the admin panel and I clicked on the settings tab. Then under the user's section making sure the making the "Require registration and login to create tickets" box is unchecked.
